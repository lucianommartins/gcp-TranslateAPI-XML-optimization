    "\n",
    "When dealing with documents based in XML format, a common struggle is how to accommodate the document to audiences with different languages. One common approach is to use Google CLoud Translation API - But, as XML docs has many tags, those extra tags are considered/counted when calculating the number of characters sent to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be found on the product documentation, Translate API billing is based on number of requests to the API and the requests are counted by every request with up to 1000 characters. More details here: https://cloud.google.com/translate/pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we gonna go through an step by step of how to perform the following tasks using Translation API:\n",
    "- digest a XML file\n",
    "- parse its relevant tags and detect their contents\n",
    "- manipulate those contents and translate it to a different language\n",
    "- create e new XML file, on the same format, but with contents translated\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important reinforce:** all those results are possible to be generated with agility and high confidence without the need of manually training, optimizing and testing machine learning models or writing machine learning code - which increases drastically the time to market of generated solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also it is very important to mention that it is a prototype and a demonstration of how it could be done. For production usage, further developments/validation/tests are required."

       " 1: 'Incertezas geradas pelo novo atrito do presidente Jair Bolsonaro com o presidente de Câmara, Rodrigo Maia, principalmente no que diz respeito à aprovação de medidas, apoiam a busca por proteção no mercado de câmbio, com reflexos nos juros futuros e bolsa. Após começo de dia de otimista, quando abriu em queda e marcou a mínima cotação do dia na casa de R$ 5,20, o dólar escalou mais de sete centavos, intensificando o ajuste positivo mais ao fim da manhã, paralelamente ao discurso do presidente Jair Bolsonaro na posse de Nelson Teich como Ministro da Saúde. Segundo profissionais, há temor sobre a votação do Orçamento de Guerra, em segundo turno, no Senado, como desdobramento do conflito Bolsonaro-Maia, que piorou o clima no Congresso. O Senado já avalia rejeitar ou deixar a medida provisória do contrato Verde Amarelo caducar. O texto estava pautado para esta sexta-feira. A relatoria do texto na Casa é do PT, contrário à medida. Senadores citam o prazo curto para analisar o texto de uma medida provisória. E a saída de Mandetta, vale lembrar, desagradou aos congressistas, acompanhada de nota conjunta pela primeira vez de Maia e do presidente do Senado, Davi Alcolumbre. Há pouco, cabe ressaltar, o governador de São Paulo, João Doria, desafeto de Bolsonaro, estendeu a quarentena no Estado até 10 de maio. Enquanto investidores trabalham em busca de proteção, o Banco Central entra no mercado, com oferta no começo da tarde de dinheiro novo, via contratos de swap cambial, o que desacelera discretamente a cotação. Fato é que persiste o fluxo de saída de investidores estrangeiros. O cenário político conturbado se impôs também no mercado futuro de juros, e as taxas sobem, em meio ainda a ajustes técnicos. Os níveis, porém, estão abaixo dos registrados uma semana atrás. Na bolsa, a troca de ministro na Saúde também não é bem vista neste momento em que o País busca maneiras de amenizar os efeitos da doença. Os ganhos são limitados pela queda das ações da Petrobras, em meio a avaliações sobre apresentação da estatal no começo desta tarde e operações relacionadas ao vencimento de opções sobre ações na segunda-feira. O sinal segue positivo e pode permitir o segundo fechamento semanal no azul. Mas se mostra frágil, até pela perda de ritmo em Nova York. Ainda assim, as ações avançam em Wall Street, sustentadas pelo pela combinação de esperanças de avanço no tratamento da covid-19, programação de reabertura da economia dos Estados Unidos e queda menor que o previsto do PIB da China no primeiro trimestre.',\n",

       " 6: 'O dólar se fortalece ante o real, após abrir em baixa, pela incerteza com o quadro político-fiscal do Brasil. Além do aumento das posições defensivas no câmbio pelo quinto dia seguido, o fluxo de saída de investidores estrangeiros do País também persiste. Houve máximas sucessivas no mercado à vista até R$ 5,2756, alta de 0,36%, após o discurso do presidente Jair Bolsonaro na posse de Nelson Teich como Ministro da Saúde. Foi quando o BC anunciou leilão novo de US$ 500 milhões em swap cambial, que foi vendido integralmente e ajudou na desaceleração apenas do dólar à vista.O gerente da Treviso Corretora, Reginaldo Galhardo, diz que, apesar do otimismo no exterior, há mal-estar com o cenário político e fiscal interno. \"As brigas do presidente Jair Bolsonaro com o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia, e o governador de São Paulo, João Doria, e a troca de ministro da Saúde elevam a cautela com o Brasil e o investidor reforça posições defensivas no dólar e há novas saídas de capitais\", afirma. Galhardo diz que aumentou a preocupação com o rombo fiscal dos Estados, o que piora as perspectivas com o déficit primário federal, por causa do isolamento social adotado pela maioria dos Estados e que deteriora a arrecadação dos entes da federação. Vanei Nagen, da Terra Investimentos, identificou naquele momento que havia temores sobre a votação do segundo turno do \"orçamento de guerra\", marcado para hoje no Senado, por causa do acirramento da briga de Bolsonaro e Maia.\"O temor é sobre o orçamento de guerra, se vai incorporar a perda de arrecadação dos estados com o isolamento social e permitir o aumento da divida dos Estados, com repasse do rombo à União, isso poderá quebrar as contas do governo federal\", afirma Nagen. A disputa política eleva esse risco, observa. A liquidez fraca ajuda a esticar a alta.Somente depois disso, o BC chamou o leilão de venda novo de US$ 500 milhões em swap cambial, o que apenas fez o dólar à vista desacelerar a alta.Elson Gusmão, analista de câmbio da Ourominas, diz que \"está pesando mais, por enquanto, a incerteza política que vivemos, com os ataques recorrentes do presidente da Republica ao presidente da Câmara. \"Muita incerteza política se sobrepondo à continuidade do bom humor externo\", avalia.Outro fator que impulsiona o dólar ante o real, enquanto no exterior os sinais estão mistos ante outras divisas emergentes, é a dúvida sobre se o novo ministro da Saúde, Nelson Teich, vai manter uma ação com base técnica no combate ao novo coronavírus ou irá ceder à pressão de Bolsonaro, acrescentou Nagen, da Terra Investimentos. \"Bolsonaro foi claro ontem ao dizer que vai fazer de tudo para acabar com o isolamento social por causa do impacto recessivo na economia, embora o STF já tenha decidido que o presidente não tem poder para isso\", comentou. A percepção de Nagen é de que a pauta do Congresso pode continuar andando, apesar dos novos ataques de Bolsonaro ao presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia. Há pouco, o governador de São Paulo, João Dória, anunciou a prorrogação da quarentena até 10 de maio. Para Jefferson Rugik, diretor-superintendente da Correpaerti, os investidores e o mercado trabalham com um viés de proteção em função do novo atrito do presidente Bolsonaro com o presidente de Câmara, Rodrigo Maia. \"Não é momento de criar conflitos e sim de pensar no povo brasileiro e na recuperação de nossa economia\", avalia o executivo. Além disso, diz que há também continuidade da saída de investidores estrangeiros do País e o spread dos bancos segue alto nas trocas cambiais à vista e futuro.No mercado à vista, às 12h30, o dólar desacelerava a alta, a R$ 5,2566 (+0,02%). No mesmo horário, o dólar futuro para maio seguia em alta, a R$ 5,2620 (+0,45%), com giro financeiro registrado de US$ 6,872 bilhões. No período, esse contrato teve mínima a R$ 5,2115 e, máxima, a R$ 5,280 (+0,79%).(Silvana Rocha - silvana.rocha@estadao.com)',\n",
       " 7: 'O agravamento do cenário político após ataques do presidente Jair Bolsonaro ao presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), fez com que os juros invertessem o sinal e passassem a subir nesta manhã. Operadores apontam também um movimento de ajuste técnico, uma vez que as taxas se encontram em níveis bem mais baixos dos que os vistos no fechamento de quinta-feira, com queda de ao redor de 50 pontos-base a partir do DI para janeiro de 2025. \"Acredito que sobem devido o temor do novo round Bolsonaro x Maia que pode fortalecer os governadores e, nesse caso, Senado aprovar o plano anti-Mansueto\", avalia José Faria Junior, sócio-diretor da Wagner Investimentos.As taxas chegaram a renovar máximas também durante o pronunciamento de Bolsonaro na posse de Nelson Teich como novo ministro da Saúde.Apesar da escalada no número de mortes e contaminados pelo covid-19 no Brasil, o presidente disse nesta manhã que pediu ao ministro da Justiça, Sérgio Moro, que reabra aos poucos as fronteiras do Brasil. Ele também questionou a decisão do Supremo Tribunal Federal de garantir autonomia a governadores e prefeitos para decretar isolamento social diante da pandemia.Outro desafeto de Bolsonaro, o governador de São Paulo, João Doria, anunciou há pouco a prorrogação da quarentena até 10 de maio em todo o Estado e capital. \"Não tomamos medidas irresponsáveis em São Paulo. Agimos de acordo com o que a ciência determina\", disse. Ele também afirmou que se solidariza com Maia e todos os parlamentares que votaram por dar recursos aos Estados. Já o Senado, em resposta a Bolsonaro, avalia rejeitar ou deixar a medida provisória do contrato Verde Amarelo caducar. O texto estava pautado para hoje e perderá a validade se não for aprovada pelos senadores até segunda-feira, 20. Nos bastidores, os motivos apontados seriam os comentários de Bolsonaro contra Congresso e a demissão de Luiz Henrique Mandetta do Ministério da Saúde. A MP cria um programa para incentivar a criação de empregos entre jovens. O governo fez um apelo para que a votação ocorra na segunda. A disposição de líderes, no entanto, é deixar a medida caducar. Às 12h33, a taxa de depósito interfinanceiro (DI) para janeiro de 2021 estava em 3,10%, de 3,05% no ajuste de ontem. O DI para janeiro de 2023 marcava 4,72%, de 4,61%, enquanto o vencimento para janeiro de 2025 exibia 6,22%, de 6,12%. (Luciana Antonello Xavier - luciana.xavier@estadao.com)',\n",

       " 16: 'O sinal do Ibovespa hoje é positivo, o que pode permitir o segundo fechamento semanal com ganhos. Apesar da valorização, a instabilidade se faz presente, o que tem sido uma praxe principalmente nesta época de crise provocada pelo novo coronavírus. Além do arrefecimento das bolsas norte-americanas, a situação local também não enseja otimismo, conforme os entrevistados. O imbróglio na política doméstica entre o Executivo e Legislativo reforça a desconfiança dos investidores, que já têm dificuldade em mensurar o impacto da pandemia sobre os preços dos ativos, assim como sobre a economia, com muitas incertezas sobre o futuro. Além disso, a troca do ministro na Saúde também não é bem vista neste momento em que o País busca maneiras de amenizar os efeitos da doença.Ainda assim, o Ibovespa sobe desde o início dos negócios embalado pela notícia - ainda de ontem - de que os EUA estão começando a se preparar para retomar as atividades em alguns estados após o isolamento social. Informações de que um novo medicamento contra a doença estaria tendo êxito também reforça o otimismo, que é respaldado também por queda menos intensa (-6,8%) do que a esperada (-8,3%) para o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) chinês no primeiro trimestre. Esse desempenho ampara as ações de mineradoras e siderúrgicas na B3, já que o Brasil é um dos principais parceiros comerciais da China. Vale ON e Usiminas PNA, por exemplo, avançavam mais de 2% perto de 12h30, enquanto Gerdau tinha ganhos de quase 6%.Às 12h39, o Ibovespa tinha alta de 0,90%, aos 78.515,92 pontos, após ser negociado entre a mínima de 77.817,46 pontos e máxima de 79.846,43 pontos, interrompendo dois dias seguidos de baixa. O volume negociado estava em R$ 7,72 bilhões, com projeção de fechar o dia em R$ 21,3 bilhões.Indícios de que a crise provocada pela pandemia terá um fim permitem valorização das bolsas, diz o estrategista-chefe da Levante Ideias de Investimentos, Rafael Bevilacqua. \"A expectativa de escalonamento de alguns segmentos da economia dos EUA que pretendem abrir seus negócios já tinha animado ontem quando o presidente Donald Trump deu a informação, e continua hoje. Além disso, os testes de cura para a doença estão avançando e, para completar, os dados da China sugerem uma recuperação em V do país\", cita.No entanto, os ganhos são limitados pelo vai-e-vem das ações da Petrobras, cujos investidores avaliam a queda de quase 8,5% do petróleo em Nova York, além das palavras do presidente da estatal, Roberto Castello Branco. Tentando tranquilizar o mercado, ele disse que a companhia está preparada para sobreviver ao pior cenário possível e que, \"apesar de declarações, a empresa não vai quebrar.\" Disse ainda que por conta da redução de demanda no Brasil, o petróleo está sendo exportado. Às 12h42, as ações da estatal tinham sinais mistos: queda de 0,13% (PN) e elevação de 0,19% (ON). Um operador lembra que a instabilidade dos papéis da Petrobras hoje também pode estar relacionada a uma antecipação do vencimento de opções sobre ações na segunda-feira, véspera de feriado no Brasil (Dia de Tiradentes). \"Se lá fora perde força, aqui também. Além do vencimento, internamente tem a briga política que atrapalha ainda mais e impede uma sustentação\", diz a fonte.A economista-chefe da Veedha Investimentos, Camila Abdelmalack, avalia que a instabilidade política eleva a desconfiança do investidor, dada a incerteza que esse desconforto pode gerar nas contas públicas e nas empresas. Em meio ao quadro da pandemia, cita, o mercado tem operado sem muita referência, tentando se amparar nas notícias positivas que estão saindo como a de que os EUA pretendem retomar as atividades mesmo com avanço de casos de coronavírus e de mortes em alguns locais. \"E isso faz com que a volatilidade deva continuar. Está sem referência, vai buscando no cotidiano algo para se apoiar. Como caiu bastante, muitos setores tentam uma recomposição\", avalia.Sobre o quadro político interno, Camila afirma que essa instabilidade já está atrapalhando e pode incomodar ainda mais no futuro. Ela lembra que o DEM, partido ao qual o ex-ministro Luiz Henrique Mandetta (Saúde) é filiado, também é o mesmo dos representantes da Câmara (Rodrigo Maia) e do Senado (Davi Alcolumbre). \"Pode-se criar um problema estrutural à frente, limitador para a economia, para as empresas\", menciona. Hoje, o oncologista Nelson Teich tomou posso no Ministério da Saúde. O anúncio da demissão de Mandetta foi feito ontem, quando o presidente Jair Bolsonaro aproveitou para atacar o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia. Em seguida, deputados de centro, direita e esquerda se solidarizaram com Maia. (Maria Regina Silva - reginam.silva@estadao.com)',\n",

O apetite por risco, que também pressionou para baixo o dólar ante rivais, porém, não se refletiu no mercado de Treasuries. Investidores mantiveram posições na renda fixa, acentuando a queda dos juros. Já o petróleo não firmou direção única, com o descompasso das expectativas de demanda e oferta ainda causando volatilidade.O mercado se animou com a notícia de que um medicamento desenvolvido pela empresa americana de biotecnologia Gilead Sciences está se mostrando promissor nos estudos para um tratamento para o novo coronavírus. \"O mercado está olhando pra frente. Um medicamento pode mudar perspectivas dos prazos de isolamento social e diminuir as preocupações com uma segunda onda de contágio\", disse ao Broadcast Marcos De Callis, estrategista da Hieron Gestora de Patrimônio e Asset. E justamente essas especulações em torno do período de quarentena deram alívio a investidores na primeira parte dos negócios desta sexta-feira, que repercutiram a coletiva de imprensa do presidente americano. Trump anunciou seu plano de reabertura da economia dos EUA na noite de ontem, na Casa Branca. O republicano dará início à normalização em maio, em três fases, e sinalizou um recuo ao garantir aos governadores o direito de decidir sobre o fim da quarentena em seus estados. \"Mesmo uma reabertura parcial da economia aliviaria bastante a pressão sobre empresas e trabalhadores, que ainda devem ter foco em manter um ambiente seguro e controlar qualquer propagação adicional do vírus\", comenta Lindsey Piegza, economista-chefe do Stifel. Pelo lado da atividade, houve certo alívio com indicadores da economia chinesa divulgados nesta madrugada. O PIB do país asiático até tombou 6,8% no primeiro trimestre - um contração do crescimento não acontecia por lá desde 1992 - como consequência direta do coronavírus, mas a leitura foi mais suave do que a projetada por analistas ouvidos pelo Wall Street Journal, que era de recuo de 8,3%. Já a produção industrial da China caiu 1,1% em março ante o mesmo mês do ano anterior, muito aquém da expectativa de queda de 7,5%. Somados os fatos, às 12h28 de Brasília, o índice Dow Jones subia 1,29%, o S&P 500 avançava 1,19% e o Nasdaq, 0,24%. Na Europa, o índice FTSE 100, da Bolsa de Londres, fechou em alta de 2,82%, o DAX, de Frankfurt, subiu 3,15% e o CAC 40, de Paris, de avançou 3,42%. O apetite por risco ainda levou para o vermelho o dólar ante rivais, que no mesmo horário cedia 0,30%, a 99,726 pontos, com a moeda americana cedendo a 107,519 ienes, o euro subindo a US$ 1,0877 e a libra esterlina, a US$ 1,2794. A tendência otimista, contudo, não se refletiu em todos os mercados, com o juro da T-note de dois anos cedendo a 0,193% no horário acima, e o da T-note de dez anos, a 0,604%. Para Callis, da Hieron, as altas do mercado acionário não representam saída de investidores da renda fixa, ainda tida como bom investimento em meio à conjuntura ainda incerta. \"O mercado de títulos ainda não está acreditando nessa mudança de cenário. O olhar é pra frente: inflação baixa, crescimento baixo, juro baixo. Então a taxa longa é baixa\", explica. \"O mercado de ações que está mais otimista. Talvez você possa dizer que há alguma bolha [na renda variável], derivada de toda essa bazuca de estímulos\", completa, salientando que setores do mercado estão avaliando o noticiário de modo diverso. Na mesma linha, a equipe do Natwest diz que o mercado de Treasuries segue olhando o \"copo meio vazio\". Além disso, o noticiário em torno das ações do Fed fica no radar. \"Esperamos uma escala de medidas para compensar o estresse\"\", avalia. O petróleo manteve-se volátil e misto desde o início dos negócios, com o contrato do WTI para junho caindo 1,76%, a US$ 25,09 o barril, e o Brent para o mesmo mês subindo 0,83%, a US$ 28,15. Além das ponderações sobre oferta e demanda, de olho nos cortes de produção da Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróleo (Opep) e nos impactos da Covid-19 sobre a atividade, operadores relatam impactos sobre as cotações do vencimento do contrato do WTI para maio, na terça-feira.

After an optimistic start to the day, when it opened in a fall and marked the day&#39;s minimum price of R $ 5.20, the dollar climbed more than seven cents, intensifying the positive adjustment later in the morning, in parallel with the president&#39;s speech Jair Bolsonaro in the possession of Nelson Teich as Minister of Health. According to professionals, there is fear about the vote on the War Budget, in the second round, in the Senate, as an outcome of the Bolsonaro-Maia conflict, which worsened the climate in Congress. The Senate is already considering rejecting or letting the provisional measure of the Green Yellow contract expire. The text was scheduled for this Friday. The report of the text in the House is of the PT, contrary to the measure. Senators cite the short deadline for analyzing the text of a provisional measure. And Mandetta&#39;s departure, it is worth remembering, displeased the congressmen, accompanied by a joint note for the first time from Maia and the president of the Senate, Davi Alcolumbre. A little while ago, it should be noted that the governor of São Paulo, João Doria, disaffected by Bolsonaro, extended the quarantine in the state until May 10. While investors are looking for protection, the Central Bank enters the market, offering new money early in the afternoon, via foreign exchange swap contracts, which slightly slows the price. The fact is that the outflow of foreign investors persists. The troubled political scenario has also imposed itself on the future interest market, and rates are rising, amid technical adjustments. The levels, however, are below those recorded a week ago. On the stock exchange, the change of minister in Health is also not well regarded at a time when the country is looking for ways to mitigate the effects of the disease. The gains are limited by the fall of Petrobras shares, amid evaluations on the presentation of the state company earlier this afternoon and operations related to the expiration of stock options on Monday. The signal remains positive and may allow the second weekly closing in the blue. But it is fragile, even due to the loss of pace in New York. Even so, the shares advance on Wall Street, supported by the combination of hopes of advancing in the treatment of the covid-19, schedule for the reopening of the United States economy and a lower than expected drop in China&#39;s GDP in the first quarter. <p> EXCHANGE <p> INTEREST <p> HANDBAG <p> INTERNATIONAL MARKETS <p> The dollar strengthens against the real, after opening lower, due to the uncertainty with the political-fiscal framework of Brazil. In addition to the increase in defensive positions in the exchange rate for the fifth consecutive day, the outflow of foreign investors from the country also persists. There were successive maximums in the spot market of up to R $ 5.2756, up 0.36%, after the speech by President Jair Bolsonaro in the office of Nelson Teich as Minister of Health. That was when the BC announced a new auction of US $ 500 million in foreign exchange swap, which was sold in its entirety and helped to decelerate only the dollar in sight. The manager of Treviso Corretora, Reginaldo Galhardo, says that despite the optimism abroad, there is unease with the domestic political and fiscal scenario. &quot;The fights of President Jair Bolsonaro with the President of the Chamber, Rodrigo Maia, and the Governor of São Paulo, João Doria, and the change of Health Minister raise caution with Brazil and the investor reinforces defensive positions in the dollar and there are new ones capital outflows &quot;, he says. Galhardo says that the concern about the fiscal gap of the states has increased, which worsens the prospects with the primary federal deficit, because of the social isolation adopted by most of the states and that deteriorates the collection of the federation&#39;s entities. Vanei Nagen, from Terra Investimentos, identified at that time that there were fears about voting for the second round of the &quot;war budget&quot;, scheduled for today in the Senate, because of the escalation of the fight between Bolsonaro and Maia. &quot;The fear is about the budget war, if it will incorporate the loss of revenue from the states with social isolation and allow an increase in the debt of the States, with the transfer of the hole to the Union, this could break the accounts of the federal government &quot;, says Nagen. The political dispute raises that risk, he notes. Weak liquidity helps to stretch the high. Only after that, the BC called the new sale auction of $ 500 million in foreign exchange swap, which only caused the dollar in sight to slow the rise. Elson Gusmão, exchange analyst at Ourominas , says that &quot;the political uncertainty we are experiencing is weighing more, for the time being, with the repeated attacks by the President of the Republic on the President of the Chamber.&quot; A lot of political uncertainty overlapping the continuity of the good external mood &quot;, he evaluates. Another factor that drives the dollar against the real, while abroad the signals are mixed against other emerging currencies, it is the question of whether the new Minister of Health, Nelson Teich, will maintain a technical based action in the fight against the new coronavirus or will yield to the pressure of Bolsonaro, added Nagen, from Terra Investimentos. &quot;Bolsonaro was clear yesterday when he said that he will do everything to end social isolation because of the recessive impact on the economy, although the STF has already decided that the president has no power. to do it &quot;, he commented. Nagen&#39;s perception is that the Congressional agenda can keep moving, despite Bolsonaro&#39;s new attacks on the mayor, Rodrigo Maia. Recently, the governor of São Paulo, João Dória, announced the extension of the quarantine until May 10. For Jefferson Rugik, director-superintendent of Correpaerti, investors and the market work with a protective bias due to the new friction between President Bolsonaro and the mayor, Rodrigo Maia. &quot;It is not a time to create conflicts, but to think about the Brazilian people and the recovery of our economy&quot;, evaluates the executive. In addition, he says that foreign investors are also leaving the country and the banks&#39; spread remains high in spot and future currency exchanges. In the spot market, at 12:30 pm, the dollar decelerated the rise, to R $ 5.2566 (+ 0.02%). At the same time, the future dollar for May continued to rise, to R $ 5.2620 (+ 0.45%), with a registered financial turnover of US $ 6.872 billion. In the period, this contract had a minimum of R $ 5.2115 and a maximum of R $ 5.280 (+0.79%). (Silvana Rocha - silvana.rocha@estadao.com) <p> The worsening of the political scenario after attacks by President Jair Bolsonaro on the mayor, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), caused interest rates to invert the signal and start to rise this morning. Operators also point to a technical adjustment movement, since rates are at much lower levels than those seen at the close of Thursday, with a drop of around 50 basis points from the DI to January 2025 . &quot;I believe that they rise due to the fear of the new Bolsonaro x Maia round that may strengthen the governors and, in this case, the Senate approve the anti-Mansueto plan&quot;, evaluates José Faria Junior, managing partner of Wagner Investimentos. maxims also during Bolsonaro&#39;s speech in possession of Nelson Teich as new Minister of Health. Despite the escalation in the number of deaths and contaminated by covid-19 in Brazil, the president said this morning that he asked the Minister of Justice, Sérgio Moro, who gradually reopens Brazil&#39;s borders. He also questioned the decision of the Supreme Court to grant autonomy to governors and mayors to decree social isolation in the face of the pandemic. Another disaffection of Bolsonaro, the governor of São Paulo, João Doria, recently announced the extension of the quarantine until May 10 in the entire state and capital. &quot;We do not take irresponsible measures in São Paulo. We act according to what science determines,&quot; he said. He also said that he sympathizes with Maia and all the parliamentarians who voted to give resources to the states. The Senate, in response to Bolsonaro, considers rejecting or letting the provisional measure of the Green Yellow contract expire. The text was scheduled for today and will expire if it is not approved by the senators until Monday, 20. Behind the scenes, the reasons given would be Bolsonaro&#39;s comments against Congress and the dismissal of Luiz Henrique Mandetta from the Ministry of Health. creates a program to encourage job creation among young people. The government has called for the vote to take place on Monday. The willingness of leaders, however, is to let the measure lapse. At 12:33 pm, the interbank deposit rate (DI) for January 2021 was 3.10%, from 3.05% in yesterday&#39;s adjustment. The DI for January 2023 was 4.72%, of 4.61%, while the maturity for January 2025 was 6.22%, of 6.12%.

Despite the recovery, instability is present, which has been a practice especially in this time of crisis caused by the new coronavirus. In addition to the cooling of US stocks, the local situation also does not give rise to optimism, according to respondents. The imbroglio in domestic politics between the Executive and Legislative reinforces the distrust of investors, who already have difficulty in measuring the impact of the pandemic on asset prices, as well as on the economy, with many uncertainties about the future. In addition, the change in the Minister for Health is also not well regarded at a time when the country is looking for ways to mitigate the effects of the disease. Even so, the Ibovespa has risen since the beginning of business, packed by the news - even yesterday - that the US is beginning to prepare to resume activities in some states after social isolation. Information that a new drug against the disease would be successful also reinforces optimism, which is also supported by a less intense drop (-6.8%) than expected (-8.3%) for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ) Chinese in the first quarter. This performance supports the shares of mining and steel companies at B3, as Brazil is one of China&#39;s main trading partners. Vale ON and Usiminas PNA, for example, advanced more than 2% close to 12:30 pm, while Gerdau had gains of almost 6%. At 12:39 pm, the Ibovespa rose 0.90%, at 78,515.92 points, after being traded between the minimum of 77,817.46 points and the maximum of 79,846.43 points, interrupting two consecutive days of decline. The volume traded was R $ 7.72 billion, with a projection to close the day at R $ 21.3 billion. Indications that the crisis caused by the pandemic will come to an end allow the valuation of the stock exchanges, says the chief strategist of Levante Ideias Investments, Rafael Bevilacqua. &quot;The expectation of escalation in some segments of the US economy that intend to open their businesses had already excited yesterday when President Donald Trump gave the information, and continues today. In addition, the cure tests for the disease are advancing and, to complete , the data from China suggest a recovery in V of the country &quot;, he cites. However, the gains are limited by the back-and-forth of Petrobras shares, whose investors estimate the fall of almost 8.5% of oil in New York , in addition to the words of the president of the state-owned company, Roberto Castello Branco. Trying to reassure the market, he said the company is prepared to survive the worst case scenario and that, &quot;despite claims, the company will not fail.&quot; He also said that due to reduced demand in Brazil, oil is being exported. At 12:42 pm, the shares of the state-owned company had mixed signals: decrease of 0.13% (PN) and increase of 0.19% (ON). An operator recalls that the instability of Petrobras&#39; shares today may also be related to an early maturity of stock options on Monday, the eve of a holiday in Brazil (Tiradentes Day). &quot;If abroad it loses strength, here too. In addition to winning, internally there is a political fight that hinders even more and prevents support,&quot; says the source.The chief economist at Veedha Investimentos, Camila Abdelmalack, estimates that political instability raises the distrust of the investor, given the uncertainty that this discomfort can generate in public accounts and companies. In the midst of the pandemic situation, he mentions, the market has been operating without much reference, trying to rest on the positive news that is coming out, such as that the USA intends to resume activities even with the advancement of cases of coronavirus and deaths in some places. &quot;And this means that the volatility should continue. It is without reference, it is looking daily for something to support itself. As it has fallen a lot, many sectors are trying to recover,&quot; he says. Regarding the internal political situation, Camila says that this instability is already getting in the way and can be even more annoying in the future. She recalls that the DEM, party to which former minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta (Health) is affiliated, is also the same as the representatives of the Chamber (Rodrigo Maia) and the Senate (Davi Alcolumbre). &quot;You can create a structural problem ahead, limiting the economy, for companies&quot;, he mentions. Today, the oncologist Nelson Teich took a chance at the Ministry of Health. The announcement of Mandetta&#39;s resignation was made yesterday, when President Jair Bolsonaro took the opportunity to attack Mayor Maia Rodrigo. Then, center, right and left deputies showed solidarity with Maia.

Bovespa Futuro <p> BOVESPA INDEX <p> Advances in treatment studies for Covid-19 have reinforced optimism among market players, who since yesterday have welcomed the plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump to reopen the local economy. The lower than expected drop in Chinese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter contributed to the positive tone, which was reflected in upward trades on the European and New York stock exchanges, where the Procter &amp; balance sheet was also well received Gamble. Risk appetite, which also pushed down the dollar against rivals, however, was not reflected in the Treasuries market. Investors maintained positions in fixed income, accentuating the fall in interest rates. Oil, on the other hand, did not establish a single direction, with the mismatch of demand and supply expectations still causing volatility. The market was encouraged by the news that a drug developed by the American biotechnology company Gilead Sciences is showing promise in studies for a treatment for the new coronavirus. &quot;The market is looking ahead. A drug can change the outlook for social isolation and reduce concerns about a second wave of contagion,&quot; Marcos De Callis, strategist at Hieron Gestora de Patrimônio e Asset, told Broadcast. And these speculations about the quarantine period have given investors relief in the first part of this Friday&#39;s business, which echoed the press conference of the American president. Trump announced his plan to reopen the U.S. economy last night at the White House. The Republican will begin normalization in May, in three phases, and signaled a retreat by granting governors the right to decide on the end of quarantine in their states. &quot;Even a partial reopening of the economy would greatly ease the pressure on companies and workers, who must still focus on maintaining a safe environment and controlling any further spread of the virus,&quot; comments Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel. On the activity side, there was some relief with indicators of the Chinese economy released this morning. The Asian country&#39;s GDP even fell by 6.8% in the first quarter - a contraction in growth that hasn&#39;t happened there since 1992 - as a direct consequence of the coronavirus, but the reading was smoother than projected by analysts surveyed by the Wall Street Journal, which was down 8.3%. China&#39;s industrial production, on the other hand, fell 1.1% in March compared to the same month of the previous year, well below expectations of a 7.5% drop. With the facts added, at 12:28 pm Brasília, the Dow Jones index rose 1.29%, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.19% and the Nasdaq, 0.24%. In Europe, the London Stock Exchange&#39;s FTSE 100 index closed up 2.82%, Frankfurt&#39;s DAX rose 3.15% and CAC 40 in Paris rose 3.42%. Risk appetite also led the dollar to red against rivals, which at the same time yielded 0.30% at 99.726 points, with the US currency yielding to 107.519 yen, the euro rising to $ 1.0877 and the pound sterling. , at $ 1.2794. The optimistic trend, however, was not reflected in all markets, with two-year T-note interest yielding 0.193% at the above time, and ten-year T-note interest at 0.604%. For Callis, from Hieron, the highs of the stock market do not represent an outflow for fixed income investors, still considered as a good investment in the midst of the uncertain scenario. &quot;The bond market is still not believing in this change in the scenario. The outlook is ahead: low inflation, low growth, low interest. So the long rate is low&quot;, he explains. &quot;The stock market is more optimistic. Perhaps you can say that there is a bubble [in variable income], derived from all this bazooka of stimuli&quot;, he adds, pointing out that sectors of the market are evaluating the news in a different way. In the same vein, the Natwest team says that the Treasuries market continues to look at the &quot;half empty glass&quot;. In addition, the news about the Fed&#39;s actions is on the radar. &quot;We expect a range of measures to compensate for the stress&quot;, &quot;he says. Oil has remained volatile and mixed since the beginning of business, with the WTI contract for June falling 1.76%, to $ 25.09 a barrel. , and Brent for the same month rising 0.83%, to $ 28.15 In addition to the considerations on supply and demand, eyeing the production cuts of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the impacts of Covid -19 on the activity, operators report impacts on the WTI contract expiration quotes for May, on Tuesday.

       " 28: 'Advances in treatment studies for Covid-19 have reinforced optimism among market players, who since yesterday have welcomed the plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump to reopen the local economy. The lower than expected drop in Chinese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter contributed to the positive tone, which was reflected in upward trades on the European and New York stock exchanges, where the Procter &amp; balance sheet was also well received Gamble. Risk appetite, which also pushed down the dollar against rivals, however, was not reflected in the Treasuries market. Investors maintained positions in fixed income, accentuating the fall in interest rates. Oil, on the other hand, did not establish a single direction, with the mismatch of demand and supply expectations still causing volatility. The market was encouraged by the news that a drug developed by the American biotechnology company Gilead Sciences is showing promise in studies for a treatment for the new coronavirus. &quot;The market is looking ahead. A drug can change the outlook for social isolation and reduce concerns about a second wave of contagion,&quot; Marcos De Callis, strategist at Hieron Gestora de Patrimônio e Asset, told Broadcast. And these speculations about the quarantine period have given investors relief in the first part of this Friday&#39;s business, which echoed the press conference of the American president. Trump announced his plan to reopen the U.S. economy last night at the White House. The Republican will begin normalization in May, in three phases, and signaled a retreat by granting governors the right to decide on the end of quarantine in their states. &quot;Even a partial reopening of the economy would greatly ease the pressure on companies and workers, who must still focus on maintaining a safe environment and controlling any further spread of the virus,&quot; comments Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel. On the activity side, there was some relief with indicators of the Chinese economy released this morning. The Asian country&#39;s GDP even fell by 6.8% in the first quarter - a contraction in growth that hasn&#39;t happened there since 1992 - as a direct consequence of the coronavirus, but the reading was smoother than projected by analysts surveyed by the Wall Street Journal, which was down 8.3%. China&#39;s industrial production, on the other hand, fell 1.1% in March compared to the same month of the previous year, well below expectations of a 7.5% drop. With the facts added, at 12:28 pm Brasília, the Dow Jones index rose 1.29%, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.19% and the Nasdaq, 0.24%. In Europe, the London Stock Exchange&#39;s FTSE 100 index closed up 2.82%, Frankfurt&#39;s DAX rose 3.15% and CAC 40 in Paris rose 3.42%. Risk appetite also led the dollar to red against rivals, which at the same time yielded 0.30% at 99.726 points, with the US currency yielding to 107.519 yen, the euro rising to $ 1.0877 and the pound sterling. , at $ 1.2794. The optimistic trend, however, was not reflected in all markets, with two-year T-note interest yielding 0.193% at the above time, and ten-year T-note interest at 0.604%. For Callis, from Hieron, the highs of the stock market do not represent an outflow for fixed income investors, still considered as a good investment in the midst of the uncertain scenario. &quot;The bond market is still not believing in this change in the scenario. The outlook is ahead: low inflation, low growth, low interest. So the long rate is low&quot;, he explains. &quot;The stock market is more optimistic. Perhaps you can say that there is a bubble [in variable income], derived from all this bazooka of stimuli&quot;, he adds, pointing out that sectors of the market are evaluating the news in a different way. In the same vein, the Natwest team says that the Treasuries market continues to look at the &quot;half empty glass&quot;. In addition, the news about the Fed&#39;s actions is on the radar. &quot;We expect a range of measures to compensate for the stress&quot;, &quot;he says. Oil has remained volatile and mixed since the beginning of business, with the WTI contract for June falling 1.76%, to $ 25.09 a barrel. , and Brent for the same month rising 0.83%, to $ 28.15 In addition to the considerations on supply and demand, eyeing the production cuts of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the impacts of Covid -19 on the activity, operators report impacts on the WTI contract expiration quotes for May, on Tuesday.

After an optimistic start to the day, when it opened in a fall and marked the day&amp;#39;s minimum price of R $ 5.20, the dollar climbed more than seven cents, intensifying the positive adjustment later in the morning, in parallel with the president&amp;#39;s speech Jair Bolsonaro in the possession of Nelson Teich as Minister of Health. According to professionals, there is fear about the vote on the War Budget, in the second round, in the Senate, as an outcome of the Bolsonaro-Maia conflict, which worsened the climate in Congress. The Senate is already considering rejecting or letting the provisional measure of the Green Yellow contract expire. The text was scheduled for this Friday. The report of the text in the House is of the PT, contrary to the measure. Senators cite the short deadline for analyzing the text of a provisional measure. And Mandetta&amp;#39;s departure, it is worth remembering, displeased the congressmen, accompanied by a joint note for the first time from Maia and the president of the Senate, Davi Alcolumbre. A little while ago, it should be noted that the governor of São Paulo, João Doria, disaffected by Bolsonaro, extended the quarantine in the state until May 10. While investors are looking for protection, the Central Bank enters the market, offering new money early in the afternoon, via foreign exchange swap contracts, which slightly slows the price. The fact is that the outflow of foreign investors persists. The troubled political scenario has also imposed itself on the future interest market, and rates are rising, amid technical adjustments. The levels, however, are below those recorded a week ago. On the stock exchange, the change of minister in Health is also not well regarded at a time when the country is looking for ways to mitigate the effects of the disease. The gains are limited by the fall of Petrobras shares, amid evaluations on the presentation of the state company earlier this afternoon and operations related to the expiration of stock options on Monday. The signal remains positive and may allow the second weekly closing in the blue. But it is fragile, even due to the loss of pace in New York. Even so, the shares advance on Wall Street, supported by the combination of hopes of advancing in the treatment of the covid-19, schedule for the reopening of the United States economy and a lower than expected drop in China&amp;#39;s GDP in the first quarter.\\n     </font>\\n     <br/>\\n     <ul>\\n      <li>\\n       <font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\">\\n        EXCHANGE\\n       </font>\\n      </li>\\n      <li>\\n       <font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\">\\n        INTEREST\\n       </font>\\n      </li>\\n      <li>\\n       <font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\">\\n        HANDBAG\\n       </font>\\n      </li>\\n      <li>\\n       <font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\">\\n        INTERNATIONAL MARKETS\\n       </font>\\n      </li>\\n     </ul>\\n     <br/>\\n     <font color=\"#336699\" face=\"arial\" size=\"2\">\\n      EXCHANGE\\n     </font>\\n     <br/>\\n     <font face=\"arial\" size=\"3\">\\n      The dollar strengthens against the real, after opening lower, due to the uncertainty with the political-fiscal framework of Brazil. In addition to the increase in defensive positions in the exchange rate for the fifth consecutive day, the outflow of foreign investors from the country also persists. There were successive maximums in the spot market of up to R $ 5.2756, up 0.36%, after the speech by President Jair Bolsonaro in the office of Nelson Teich as Minister of Health. That was when the BC announced a new auction of US $ 500 million in foreign exchange swap, which was sold in its entirety and helped to decelerate only the dollar in sight. The manager of Treviso Corretora, Reginaldo Galhardo, says that despite the optimism abroad, there is unease with the domestic political and fiscal scenario. &amp;quot;The fights of President Jair Bolsonaro with the President of the Chamber, Rodrigo Maia, and the Governor of São Paulo, João Doria, and the change of Health Minister raise caution with Brazil and the investor reinforces defensive positions in the dollar and there are new ones capital outflows &amp;quot;, he says. Galhardo says that the concern about the fiscal gap of the states has increased, which worsens the prospects with the primary federal deficit, because of the social isolation adopted by most of the states and that deteriorates the collection of the federation&amp;#39;s entities. Vanei Nagen, from Terra Investimentos, identified at that time that there were fears about voting for the second round of the &amp;quot;war budget&amp;quot;, scheduled for today in the Senate, because of the escalation of the fight between Bolsonaro and Maia. &amp;quot;The fear is about the budget war, if it will incorporate the loss of revenue from the states with social isolation and allow an increase in the debt of the States, with the transfer of the hole to the Union, this could break the accounts of the federal government &amp;quot;, says Nagen. The political dispute raises that risk, he notes. Weak liquidity helps to stretch the high. Only after that, the BC called the new sale auction of $ 500 million in foreign exchange swap, which only caused the dollar in sight to slow the rise. Elson Gusmão, exchange analyst at Ourominas , says that &amp;quot;the political uncertainty we are experiencing is weighing more, for the time being, with the repeated attacks by the President of the Republic on the President of the Chamber.&amp;quot; A lot of political uncertainty overlapping the continuity of the good external mood &amp;quot;, he evaluates. Another factor that drives the dollar against the real, while abroad the signals are mixed against other emerging currencies, it is the question of whether the new Minister of Health, Nelson Teich, will maintain a technical based action in the fight against the new coronavirus or will yield to the pressure of Bolsonaro, added Nagen, from Terra Investimentos. &amp;quot;Bolsonaro was clear yesterday when he said that he will do everything to end social isolation because of the recessive impact on the economy, although the STF has already decided that the president has no power. to do it &amp;quot;, he commented. Nagen&amp;#39;s perception is that the Congressional agenda can keep moving, despite Bolsonaro&amp;#39;s new attacks on the mayor, Rodrigo Maia. Recently, the governor of São Paulo, João Dória, announced the extension of the quarantine until May 10. For Jefferson Rugik, director-superintendent of Correpaerti, investors and the market work with a protective bias due to the new friction between President Bolsonaro and the mayor, Rodrigo Maia. &amp;quot;It is not a time to create conflicts, but to think about the Brazilian people and the recovery of our economy&amp;quot;, evaluates the executive. In addition, he says that foreign investors are also leaving the country and the banks&amp;#39; spread remains high in spot and future currency exchanges. In the spot market, at 12:30 pm, the dollar decelerated the rise, to R $ 5.2566 (+ 0.02%). At the same time, the future dollar for May continued to rise, to R $ 5.2620 (+ 0.45%), with a registered financial turnover of US $ 6.872 billion. In the period, this contract had a minimum of R $ 5.2115 and a maximum of R $ 5.280 (+0.79%).

Operators also point to a technical adjustment movement, since rates are at much lower levels than those seen at the close of Thursday, with a drop of around 50 basis points from the DI to January 2025 . &amp;quot;I believe that they rise due to the fear of the new Bolsonaro x Maia round that may strengthen the governors and, in this case, the Senate approve the anti-Mansueto plan&amp;quot;, evaluates José Faria Junior, managing partner of Wagner Investimentos. maxims also during Bolsonaro&amp;#39;s speech in possession of Nelson Teich as new Minister of Health. Despite the escalation in the number of deaths and contaminated by covid-19 in Brazil, the president said this morning that he asked the Minister of Justice, Sérgio Moro, who gradually reopens Brazil&amp;#39;s borders. He also questioned the decision of the Supreme Court to grant autonomy to governors and mayors to decree social isolation in the face of the pandemic. Another disaffection of Bolsonaro, the governor of São Paulo, João Doria, recently announced the extension of the quarantine until May 10 in the entire state and capital. &amp;quot;We do not take irresponsible measures in São Paulo. We act according to what science determines,&amp;quot; he said. He also said that he sympathizes with Maia and all the parliamentarians who voted to give resources to the states. The Senate, in response to Bolsonaro, considers rejecting or letting the provisional measure of the Green Yellow contract expire. The text was scheduled for today and will expire if it is not approved by the senators until Monday, 20. Behind the scenes, the reasons given would be Bolsonaro&amp;#39;s comments against Congress and the dismissal of Luiz Henrique Mandetta from the Ministry of Health. creates a program to encourage job creation among young people. The government has called for the vote to take place on Monday. The willingness of leaders, however, is to let the measure lapse. At 12:33 pm, the interbank deposit rate (DI) for January 2021 was 3.10%, from 3.05% in yesterday&amp;#39;s adjustment. The DI for January 2023 was 4.72%, of 4.61%, while the maturity for January 2025 was 6.22%, of 6.12%.

Despite the recovery, instability is present, which has been a practice especially in this time of crisis caused by the new coronavirus. In addition to the cooling of US stocks, the local situation also does not give rise to optimism, according to respondents. The imbroglio in domestic politics between the Executive and Legislative reinforces the distrust of investors, who already have difficulty in measuring the impact of the pandemic on asset prices, as well as on the economy, with many uncertainties about the future. In addition, the change in the Minister for Health is also not well regarded at a time when the country is looking for ways to mitigate the effects of the disease. Even so, the Ibovespa has risen since the beginning of business, packed by the news - even yesterday - that the US is beginning to prepare to resume activities in some states after social isolation. Information that a new drug against the disease would be successful also reinforces optimism, which is also supported by a less intense drop (-6.8%) than expected (-8.3%) for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ) Chinese in the first quarter. This performance supports the shares of mining and steel companies at B3, as Brazil is one of China&amp;#39;s main trading partners. Vale ON and Usiminas PNA, for example, advanced more than 2% close to 12:30 pm, while Gerdau had gains of almost 6%. At 12:39 pm, the Ibovespa rose 0.90%, at 78,515.92 points, after being traded between the minimum of 77,817.46 points and the maximum of 79,846.43 points, interrupting two consecutive days of decline. The volume traded was R $ 7.72 billion, with a projection to close the day at R $ 21.3 billion. Indications that the crisis caused by the pandemic will come to an end allow the valuation of the stock exchanges, says the chief strategist of Levante Ideias Investments, Rafael Bevilacqua. &amp;quot;The expectation of escalation in some segments of the US economy that intend to open their businesses had already excited yesterday when President Donald Trump gave the information, and continues today. In addition, the cure tests for the disease are advancing and, to complete , the data from China suggest a recovery in V of the country &amp;quot;, he cites. However, the gains are limited by the back-and-forth of Petrobras shares, whose investors estimate the fall of almost 8.5% of oil in New York , in addition to the words of the president of the state-owned company, Roberto Castello Branco. Trying to reassure the market, he said the company is prepared to survive the worst case scenario and that, &amp;quot;despite claims, the company will not fail.&amp;quot; He also said that due to reduced demand in Brazil, oil is being exported. At 12:42 pm, the shares of the state-owned company had mixed signals: decrease of 0.13% (PN) and increase of 0.19% (ON). An operator recalls that the instability of Petrobras&amp;#39; shares today may also be related to an early maturity of stock options on Monday, the eve of a holiday in Brazil (Tiradentes Day). &amp;quot;If abroad it loses strength, here too. In addition to winning, internally there is a political fight that hinders even more and prevents support,&amp;quot; says the source.The chief economist at Veedha Investimentos, Camila Abdelmalack, estimates that political instability raises the distrust of the investor, given the uncertainty that this discomfort can generate in public accounts and companies. In the midst of the pandemic situation, he mentions, the market has been operating without much reference, trying to rest on the positive news that is coming out, such as that the USA intends to resume activities even with the advancement of cases of coronavirus and deaths in some places. &amp;quot;And this means that the volatility should continue. It is without reference, it is looking daily for something to support itself. As it has fallen a lot, many sectors are trying to recover,&amp;quot; he says. Regarding the internal political situation, Camila says that this instability is already getting in the way and can be even more annoying in the future. She recalls that the DEM, party to which former minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta (Health) is affiliated, is also the same as the representatives of the Chamber (Rodrigo Maia) and the Senate (Davi Alcolumbre). &amp;quot;You can create a structural problem ahead, limiting the economy, for companies&amp;quot;, he mentions. Today, the oncologist Nelson Teich took a chance at the Ministry of Health. The announcement of Mandetta&amp;#39;s resignation was made yesterday, when President Jair Bolsonaro took the opportunity to attack Mayor Maia Rodrigo. Then, center, right and left deputies showed solidarity with Maia.

The lower than expected drop in Chinese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter contributed to the positive tone, which was reflected in upward trades on the European and New York stock exchanges, where the Procter &amp;amp; balance sheet was also well received Gamble. Risk appetite, which also pushed down the dollar against rivals, however, was not reflected in the Treasuries market. Investors maintained positions in fixed income, accentuating the fall in interest rates. Oil, on the other hand, did not establish a single direction, with the mismatch of demand and supply expectations still causing volatility. The market was encouraged by the news that a drug developed by the American biotechnology company Gilead Sciences is showing promise in studies for a treatment for the new coronavirus. &amp;quot;The market is looking ahead. A drug can change the outlook for social isolation and reduce concerns about a second wave of contagion,&amp;quot; Marcos De Callis, strategist at Hieron Gestora de Patrimônio e Asset, told Broadcast. And these speculations about the quarantine period have given investors relief in the first part of this Friday&amp;#39;s business, which echoed the press conference of the American president. Trump announced his plan to reopen the U.S. economy last night at the White House. The Republican will begin normalization in May, in three phases, and signaled a retreat by granting governors the right to decide on the end of quarantine in their states. &amp;quot;Even a partial reopening of the economy would greatly ease the pressure on companies and workers, who must still focus on maintaining a safe environment and controlling any further spread of the virus,&amp;quot; comments Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel. On the activity side, there was some relief with indicators of the Chinese economy released this morning. The Asian country&amp;#39;s GDP even fell by 6.8% in the first quarter - a contraction in growth that hasn&amp;#39;t happened there since 1992 - as a direct consequence of the coronavirus, but the reading was smoother than projected by analysts surveyed by the Wall Street Journal, which was down 8.3%. China&amp;#39;s industrial production, on the other hand, fell 1.1% in March compared to the same month of the previous year, well below expectations of a 7.5% drop. With the facts added, at 12:28 pm Brasília, the Dow Jones index rose 1.29%, the S&amp;amp;P 500 advanced 1.19% and the Nasdaq, 0.24%. In Europe, the London Stock Exchange&amp;#39;s FTSE 100 index closed up 2.82%, Frankfurt&amp;#39;s DAX rose 3.15% and CAC 40 in Paris rose 3.42%. Risk appetite also led the dollar to red against rivals, which at the same time yielded 0.30% at 99.726 points, with the US currency yielding to 107.519 yen, the euro rising to $ 1.0877 and the pound sterling. , at $ 1.2794. The optimistic trend, however, was not reflected in all markets, with two-year T-note interest yielding 0.193% at the above time, and ten-year T-note interest at 0.604%. For Callis, from Hieron, the highs of the stock market do not represent an outflow for fixed income investors, still considered as a good investment in the midst of the uncertain scenario. &amp;quot;The bond market is still not believing in this change in the scenario. The outlook is ahead: low inflation, low growth, low interest. So the long rate is low&amp;quot;, he explains. &amp;quot;The stock market is more optimistic. Perhaps you can say that there is a bubble [in variable income], derived from all this bazooka of stimuli&amp;quot;, he adds, pointing out that sectors of the market are evaluating the news in a different way. In the same vein, the Natwest team says that the Treasuries market continues to look at the &amp;quot;half empty glass&amp;quot;. In addition, the news about the Fed&amp;#39;s actions is on the radar. &amp;quot;We expect a range of measures to compensate for the stress&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;he says. Oil has remained volatile and mixed since the beginning of business, with the WTI contract for June falling 1.76%, to $ 25.09 a barrel. , and Brent for the same month rising 0.83%, to $ 28.15 In addition to the considerations on supply and demand, eyeing the production cuts of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the impacts of Covid -19 on the activity, operators report impacts on the WTI contract expiration quotes for May, on Tuesday.
